# Customer Credit Scoring Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for our Data Mining class project, focusing on customer credit scoring. The goal of this project is to develop a robust credit scoring model that can assess the creditworthiness of customers based on various features and historical data.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the credit scoring model. Make sure to keep this data up-to-date and provide clear instructions on how to obtain the latest dataset.

- **`src/`**: The source code for the credit scoring model is organized in this directory. We have implemented various algorithms and techniques for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. Each script or notebook should be well-documented, and clear explanations should be provided for the logic behind the decisions made.

- **`models/`**: Once the models are trained, they can be saved in this directory. Include information on how to load and use these models for credit scoring.

- **`docs/`**: This directory contains documentation for the project. Include information on the dataset, model architecture, and any important considerations when using the credit scoring model.

## Getting Started
